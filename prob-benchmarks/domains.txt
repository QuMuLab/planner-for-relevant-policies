(TODO) Check if the policy scores match what the simulator gives (they should).

rectangle-tireworld
- OK
-- /SO/ many bugs in this domain. It's still royally stupid / easy to solve, but whatever...
-- Most of the problems are unsolvable with the (not (dead)) addition to the goal
-- Probably best to skip this domain

schedule
- The conditional effects are too complex to compile away.

search-and-rescue
- Buggy:
-- I think there may be a problem with the re-encoding (it should be forced to explore more areas).

sysAdmin-SLP
- The conditional effects are too complex to compile away.

triangle-tireworld
- OK

zenotravel
- OK
-- Not so interesting in the context of MAXPROB -- no policy repair is required, and the metric is ignored.
-- Maybe the use of highly probably outcomes gives an interesting result in this domain? It could select
   things that are cheaper (as they are more probable).
