;;; This domain is inspired from triangle-tireworld, itself inspired
;;; by tireworld.

;;; A major difference is that there is no more spare tire to pick-up.
;;; The goal is to cross a rectangle world (usually from the
;;; bottom-left to the upper-right corner), with 8 possible moves:
;;; - 4 normal moves: U, D, R, L (uncertain if you are not on a "safe"
;;; row or column),
;;; - 4 diagonal moves: UR, UL, DR, DL (fast but dangerous moves).
;;; Any move is deadly if you leave an "unsafe" location.
;;;
;;; As in (triangle-)tireworld, deterministic planners are expected to
;;; look for short, but dangerous paths. An advantage over
;;; (triangle-)tireworld is that less variables are required to encode
;;; large problems.
