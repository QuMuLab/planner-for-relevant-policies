Citation:

Usage:
./src/plan-prp <domain> <problem> <output file> OPTIONS

Options:
--jic-limit TIME_LIMIT
    Only perform JIC for the given time.

--forgetpolicy 1/0
    Throw out the policy after every simulation.

--fullstate 1/0
    Use full states in the regression.

--planlocal 1/0
    Plan locally to recover before planning for the goal.

--partial-planlocal 1/0
    Use the partial state that matches the expect state when planning locally.

--limit-planlocal 1/0
    Limit the planlocal searching to a fixed number of search steps.

--plan-with-policy 1/0
    Stop searching when the policy matches the current state.

--trials NUM_TRIALS
    Number of trials to run for the simulator.

--detect-deadends 1/0
    Use primitive deadend detection to ensure a strongly cyclic solution.

--generalize-deadends 1/0
    Generalize the deadends found based on relaxed reachability.

--online-deadends 1/0
    Generate and store deadend states that are found online.

--optimized-scd 1/0
    Perform optimized strong cyclic detection when checking the partial policy.

--dump-policy 1/2
    Dump the policy to the file policy.out. 1 creates a switch graph, while 2 creates a human readable form.
